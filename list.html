<h4>Java</h4>
<p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed for portability across platforms. 
<i>It allows developers to write code once and run it anywhere that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</i> 
Java is widely used for building web applications, mobile applications, and large-scale enterprise systems due to its robustness, 
security features, and extensive libraries.
