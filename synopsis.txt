 1) Introduction

**Introduction**:  
The Chat GPT Clone is a web-based application that enables users to interact with an AI-powered chatbot using natural language. 
Built with Streamlit and Cohere's language model from Langchain, this project focuses on creating an engaging user experience for conversational AI.

**Features**:
- Interactive chat interface for user input and AI responses.
- Maintains conversation history for context.
- Summarization feature to review the conversation easily.
- Secure input for API keys to access the Cohere language model.

**Existing System and Need for System**:  
Currently, most chatbot applications lack seamless user interaction and context management. Many existing systems do not allow for effective summarization of past conversations, which can hinder user engagement. The Chat GPT Clone addresses these shortcomings by providing a more dynamic and user-friendly interface, making it easier to access information and interact with AI.

**Scope of Work**:  
The scope of this project includes:
- Developing a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.
- Implementing the Cohere language model to handle user queries.
- Creating an effective memory management system to maintain conversation context.
- Allowing users to summarize their conversations.

**Operating System**:  
The application is designed to run on any operating system that supports Python and Streamlit, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### 2) Proposed System

**Proposed System**:  
The proposed system is a fully functional chatbot that leverages the Cohere language model to provide intelligent responses to user inquiries. It includes features for conversation management, summarization, and secure handling of API keys.

**Feasibility Study**:  
- **a) Technical Feasibility**:  
  The project is technically feasible as it utilizes existing technologies (Streamlit, Cohere API) that are well-supported and documented. The integration of these technologies allows for efficient development and deployment.

- **b) Economical Feasibility**:  
  Economically, the project is viable due to the relatively low costs of cloud services and APIs. The use of open-source technologies and frameworks minimizes development expenses, making it accessible for small businesses or individual developers.

- **c) Operational Feasibility**:  
  The application is operationally feasible as it can be deployed on standard web servers, accessible to users through a web browser. The user-friendly interface ensures that even non-technical users can interact with the chatbot effectively.

**Objectives of the System**:  
- To create a responsive and intuitive chatbot application that mimics human-like conversation.
- To provide users with a mechanism to summarize their interactions with the chatbot.
- To enable effective memory management for maintaining context in conversations.

**User Requirements**:  
- Users should be able to input text and receive coherent, relevant responses from the AI.
- The application should maintain a history of interactions for the user's reference.
- Users must securely input and manage their API keys.
- The summarization feature should provide a concise recap of the conversation. 

This structured approach not only outlines the functionality and feasibility of the Chat GPT Clone but also emphasizes its significance in enhancing user experience with AI-driven interactions.
